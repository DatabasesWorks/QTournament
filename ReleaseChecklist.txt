Preparation and source baselining
=================================

  * Make sure that the code compiles and runs under Windows

  * Add / modify the version number in the libs' .pro-files

  * Compile the support libs (reports and DB) and QTournament
    with "release" settings under Linux and Windows

  * Make sure the release-compiled program works under Linux and Windows

  * Commit and push changes to support libs (reports and DB)

  * Assign version tags to support libs and push tags


Build final release version of QTournament
==========================================

  * In 'dev' branch: set version number in MainFrame.h

  * Add / modify the version number in the app's .pro-files

  * Merge 'dev' with 'staged' and finally 'staged' with 'master'

  * Commit and push all changes

  * Compile release version for Linux and Windows

  * Make sure everything works fine (esp. under Windows)

  * Tag 'master' branch with version number.
    Use an annotated tag and include required version numbers of the
    support libs in the comment

  * Push all tags

  * Create ZIP archives and create SHA1s and digital signatures


Cleanup
=======

  * Checkout 'dev' in both the Windows and Linux source tree

  * Reset the version string in MainFrame.h to '<DevelopmentSnapshot>'

  * Commit and push the change
